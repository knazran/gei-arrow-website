But in recent years, there seems to be a negative connotation to “feminism.” Not only do some actively push back against feminism, others, even some who support gender equality, do not like being labelled as a feminist. But why? On the first episode of Today I Learned, we explore feminism with Sivananthi Thanenthiran. What exactly is it? And why do some see it as a dirty word.
