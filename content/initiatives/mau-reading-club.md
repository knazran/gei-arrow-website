MAU Reading Club is an ongoing initiative that began in 2020 to encourage members and our audience to read and openly speak about issues pertaining to Child Sexual Abuse and Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. It is held every Friday from 9 pm to 10 pm, an hour-long discussion where both the respective speakers and members of MAU have the opportunity to interact with one another in a safe and open space. 

There is a variety of speakers and topics presented every week which allows members to learn an expansive range of topics across the year. When the Covid-19 pandemic struck the doors of Malaysia and citizens were told to isolate themselves under the lockdown protocols, this Reading Club has proven to be a comfortable and safe virtual environment for members of the NGO as well as onlookers to ease their minds and have fruitful discussions regarding social issues that affect them as citizens of Malaysia. 

MAU has had a broad range of speakers such as:- 
- **Ain Husniza** from #MakeSchoolsASaferPlace 
    - Who spoke about sexual harassment of children in schools.  

- **Fir Redzuan**, Founder of MAU 
    - Who spoke about the International Day of Action for Women’s Health as well as many other topics such as family toxicity and incest. 

- **Dr. Noor Awanis Muslim** 
    - Who spoke about World Consumer Rights: Are We Right? (as a consumer) 

- **Saidah Salim**
    - Who spoke about being a polyglot and growing up speaking 7 languages. 

- **Laven** from Kau Ok Tak?  and MAU member
    - Who spoke about Pride 2021 and learning about gender and sexuality in school. 

MAU are always more than happy to welcome speakers from all diversities to speak about anything that they are passionate about, however, we would like to emphasize that any speakers that partake in our weekly Reading Club session are required to provide a source of information that could be shared with the members regarding the topic that would be discussed by the respective speakers.
