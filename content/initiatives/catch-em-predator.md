## Background

Catch Em’ Predator Workshop is a side event under the <nuxt-link to="/lapor-predatory">Lapor Predator initiative</nuxt-link> to promote dialogue about online safety and better equip the participants in dealing with potential and existing threats. Aware of the need of integrating comprehensive and age appropriate sexual education that addresses cultural aspects of the digital world like consent, notions of privacy and sexting, MAU has developed specific content for each targeted age group. The workshop is free of charge as we aim to elevate as many beneficiaries as we can when it comes to online safety.

It is conducted on a bi-weekly basis starting from June 2021 till December 2021.
