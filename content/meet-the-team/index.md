        Farah is someone who loves to learn and try out new things either from her curious nature or interest in something. This led her to participate in Lapor Predator despite not being used to the task before. Interestingly, she finds it oddly enjoyable to commit herself to it.Through her university days, she has had the opportunity to participate in research via her assistance in competitions, a different university organization or her time of doing her summer-course programme in her second-year as an undergraduate student. She hopes that her participation in this role will help her grasp better on the issues happening either through Lapor chatbot or matters that MAU has been trying to combat on so that she can assist her circles or public on their available rights and hopefully, it will encourage them to play an active role in curbing such issues
