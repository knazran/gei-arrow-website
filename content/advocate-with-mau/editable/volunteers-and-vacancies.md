title: Volunteers & Vacancies
description: From our symposium days to helping children and families through
  our Lapor Predator chatbot, we could not have accomplished all of it without
  the support from our dedicated and supportive volunteers. We believe in the
  power of people and we are looking for youths and individuals of any
  background that are interested to help out in making a difference. If you're
  on break, still studying, or simply looking for something to invest your time
  and energy in, CSA prevention might just be your thing.

From our symposium days to helping children through our Lapor Predator chatbot, we would not have accomplished much without the support of our team. We believe in the power of the people and are therefore looking for youths and individuals from any background who share our vision. If you are on a break, still studying, or are simply looking for something to invest your time and energy in, consider working with us!

We provide volunteering and job opportunities of varying levels of workload and challenges, and we promise there is something for everyone. If this sounds like a great opportunity, reach out to us so we can work together!
