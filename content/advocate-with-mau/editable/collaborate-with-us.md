Reach out to our Public Relations Officer (kaiser@laporpredator.org) to explore how we can create magic together!

We have learnt that involving the community around us in advocating for children’s rights is the starting point for raising and spreading awareness. With that, we would love to have your company, community group, school or organization to learn more about MAU and be a part of our cause in combating systemic violence against children. We welcome any opportunity to share our mission and the various ways for the public to get involved to make a difference in the lives of children and the youth.

Currently, MAU offers customised training programmes that we develop and run for students (highschool to university) and the general public. If you’re interested in inviting a speaker for a session, collaborating with us for events, getting trained, or finding out more information about our work, do c​ontact us and we will get back to you as soon as we can.
