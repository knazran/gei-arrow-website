## Conceptualizing SRHR

### Bite-Sized Definition
Holistic wellbeing in all aspects of sexuality and reproduction.

### Definition from the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission on SRHR
In 2018, the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (Starrs et al., 2018) issued a definition of SRHR based on findings from the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and subsequent global agreements and human rights treaties and principles. The Commission defined SRHR as: 

> “A state of physical, emotional, mental, and social wellbeing in relation to all aspects of sexuality and reproduction, not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity."

#### What does this mean?

This means that SRHR does not only include sexual practices and rights, but also includes issues like abortion, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), maternal health and rights, contraceptive access, gender-based violence, discrimination and stigma, and more. As such, SRHR comprises the nine (9) sections below as depicted in the diagram found in the background document for the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 - Accelerating the Promise, titled: Sexual Health and Reproductive Rights: An Essential Element of Universal Health Coverage.

### Analytical Definition

Considered separately or distinctly, one can understand the term from the following 4 facets[^7]:

#### 1. Sexual Health
- Healthy sexual development
- Equitable and responsible relationships and sexual fulfilment
    - e.g., Polygamy is considered a gender-based violence when consent is not duly obtained
- Protection against/Freedom from STIs or venereal diseases:
    1. Chlamydia
    2. Syphilis
    3. Gonorrhoea
    4. HIV
    5. Non-specific urethritis
    6. Pubic lice
    7. Scabies and more 
- Protection against/Freedom from disability, harassment, violence and other harmful practices related to sexuality
    - e.g., Discriminatory laws against the LGBTQI+ community that lead to pervasive transphobia in Malaysia and human rights violations against the trans community, which have resulted in indignity, harassment, and even extreme violence leading to murders.

#### 2. Sexual rights - The rights to decide autonomously yet responsibly on all aspects of their sexuality, including:
- protecting and promoting their sexual health
- being free from discrimination, coercion or violence in their sexual lives and in the making of all sexual decisions
- being able to expect and demand equality, mutual respect and shared responsibility in sexual relationships
- the right to reject sex if they do not want it i.e., the right to give or withhold consent

#### 3. Reproductive health
- **Physical wellbeing:** the right to enjoy a life free from disease or infirmity related to the reproductive system, its functions and processes
- **Mental wellbeing:** the right to enjoy a satisfying and safe sex life 
- **Social wellbeing:** the capacity to have/not have children and the freedom to decide if, when and how often you want to


Nonetheless, all of the above are not independent issues. Each of them overlaps, superimposes and merges with others. In brief, to look at SRHR is to consider comprehensively all issues related to sexual and reproductive health from the lenses of physicality, physiology, psychology and sociality. 

## What is considered a violation of SRHR?
Reference: [^8] [^9]

- restricted/denial of access to services that only women require (e.g., menstrual needs, maternal care)
- denied autonomy in deciding if you want to engage in sexual and/or reproductive practices and when and how you do it, without discrimination, coercion, and violence
- poor quality health/counselling/family planning services
- physical, psychological or sexual harm perpetrated by anyone (even in relationships)
- subjecting women’s access to such services to third party authorization
- coerced sterilization/virginity examinations or forced abortions, especially with the women’s consent being a dubious question
- limited access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning and contraception as well as other methods of the individual’s choice
- FGMC, which includes khitan (Arabic for female circumcision) [^10]
- early marriage

The above elaborations clearly demonstrate how far Malaysia still has to go in terms of SRHR. 

## Why is SRHR important?
Ideally, SRHR aims to universally:
1. Uphold women’s autonomy over their lives 
2. Promote gender equality
3. Protect women, girls, and other marginalised sexual identities
4. Safeguard women’s wellbeing and its impact on maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health 
5. Strengthen young people’s individual resilience and create the conditions under which they can achieve their full potential (ICPD, 2021)
6. Positively affect knowledge and behaviours and contribute to delayed initiation of sexual activity (Plan International, 2021)
7. Shape future economic development 
8. Promote environmental sustainability

## Barriers to Ratifying SRHR in Malaysia

### A Dissatisfactory Sexual Education Syllabus

During the ICPD attended by more than 170 countries in Cairo, Egypt, points were raised to determine ways in which the youth can equally access SRHR. It was agreed that this may be done by imparting comprehensive sexuality education to:

1. Ensure that young people are protected from unwanted pregnancies
2. Ensure that young people are protected from HIV and STDs
3. Encourage tolerance and mutual respect and in turn discourage violence in relationships
4. Allow young people to hold the greatest autonomy over their lives

However, Malaysia through its Pendidikan Kesihatan Reproduktif dan Sosial (PEERS) initiative deviates from the recommended design of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) programmes. This is illustrated in the following diagram and table:

| Recommended Design of CSE by ICPD      | PEERS Syllabus Coverage in Malaysia |
| ----------- | :----:  |
| 1. Growth and development      | ✅        |
| 2. Anatomy and physiology   | ❌        |
| 3. Reproduction     | ❌        |
| 4. Pregnancy and childbirth   | ✅        |
| 5. Contraception     | ❌        |
| 6. HIV and STDs   | ✅        |
| 7. Family life and interpersonal relationships     | Most of the discussion revolves around marriage but not sexual behaviour or sexual abuse       |
| 8. Culture and sexuality   | ❌        |
| 9. Human rights      | ❌        |
| 10. Fulfilment and empowerment   | ❌        |
| 11. Equality and gender roles      | Gender roles are introduced but conform to convention     |
| 12. Sexual behaviour   | ❌        |
| 13. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful sexual practices such as FGMC and child/early/forced marriage      | ❌       |

Evidently, PEERS discusses issues from a strict abstinence and moral perspective and is a syllabus containing religious and ethical narratives which are neither realistic nor representative. Several scholars argue that the success of the educational content is hindered by misconceptions of the impact of sexuality education, disagreements on the curriculum, low availability of qualified teachers, lack of family and parental involvement as well as poor multi-disciplinary collaborations[^11]. Similarly, Khalaf et al. (2014) found that barriers to sexuality education can be measured by five (5) aspects: feasibility, acceptability, accountability, strategies, and community awareness.[^12]


## What we can do to uphold SRHR

### 1. Volunteer/Work for organizations in Malaysia that advocate for SRHR such as the Federation of Reproductive Health Associations, Malaysia (FRHAM), which:
- Is an implementing partner of United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) which organizes sexual and reproductive health programmes in Malaysia;
- Has branches in all states; and
- Educates and provides knowledge to difficult-to-reach communities by conducting health screenings, blood tests, pap smears and mammograms, as well as providing access to long-acting reversible contraceptives and general advice on sexual and reproductive healthcare.

### 2. Speak up on/report violations of SRHR
- Report sexual abuse or harassment via the WAO hotline
- Report online sexual abuse and CSA via the Lapor Predator chatbot

### 3. Equip yourself with a solid understanding of SRHR
- Know that you have the right to reject any sexual requests for any reason whatsoever (even when they are from your husband/wife, boyfriend/girlfriend or any other intimate partners)
- Know that you are free to accept/reject any treatment related to the reproductive system (even when people in traditionally superior positions to you in life such as parents want you to accept/reject, contrary to your personal choice)
- Know that you are entitled to accessible sexual and reproductive healthcare, be it psychological or physiological/physical
- Know that you are the only person with the authority and responsibility to make decisions relating to your body and sexuality
