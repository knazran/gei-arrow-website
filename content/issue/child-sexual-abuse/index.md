## Conceptualizing CSA

### (1.0) Bite-Sized Definition
A self-gratifying[^6] act through sexually exploiting a child.

### (2.0) Analytical Definition
An act is considered CSA when it involves the following aspects[^7]:
- **Child** : An individual under the age of 18. 
- **Sexual**: The act is sexual in terms of the person’s physical or mental gratification, whether  deferred, immediate or temporally, and is also sexual in terms of the child’s experience.
- **Abuse**: Conduct which exploits the child’s inability to give informed consent using the power imbalance between an adult and a child.

### (2.1) Key Agents in CSA

**Who is a child?**

According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), a child is defined as ‘Every human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child majority is attained earlier’.

**Who is an abuser?**

Usually a trusted acquaintance of the child who holds a significant amount of power and authority over the child. Hence, they possess the influence to entice the child into a sexual relationship using their dominance derived from the child’s minority, dependency and subordinate position.

**Can you identify an abuser?**

Research shows that perpetrators exhibit no unique traits compared to the common Joe. In layman terms, they look just like us.
However, an abuser may be identified by six clinical characteristics: denial, sexual arousal, sexual fantasy, social skills, cognitive distortions, and other psychological and social problems.[^8]

**Did You Know?**

Sexual Assault versus Sexual Abuse[^9]:
Sexual abuse and sexual assault may overlap and be interchangeable, as they are both forms of sexual violence. However, CSA refers to child sexual abuse and not child sexual assault. 

### (3.0) Legal definition of CSA:

In Malaysia, the [Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 (SOAC)](https://cljlaw.com/files/bills/pdf/2017/MY_FS_BIL_2017_06.pdf) was enforced on the 10th of July, 2017 to protect children from sexual crimes. 
It is worthy to note that the act does not explicitly specify CSA in legal terms. However, the act does specify what child pornography (or CSA material, which is the term we prefer) means. To read more about this, [click here](/focus-area/online-child-sexual-abuse)

### (3.1) Key takeaways of the Act [^10]

#### 1. Involvement in CSA material (including where any person is portrayed as a child as defined in Section 4) is prohibited

<ol type="a" class='pl-8'>
  <li>Section 5 <strong>prohibits</strong> all forms of involvement in <strong>creating</strong> CSA material.</li>
  <li>Section 7 <strong>interdicts utilizing a child</strong> to produce CSA material.</li>
  <li>Section 8 <strong>prohibits the distribution</strong> of CSA material.</li>
  <li>Section 10 <strong>interdicts the consumption</strong>  of CSA material.</li>
</ol>

**2. Sexual grooming is a crime.**

<ol type="a" class='pl-8'>
  <li>Section 11 **prohibits** the engagement in or encouragement of **sexual communication with a child**, except for purposes of medicine, education or communication (see subsection 3).</li>
  <li>Section 12 **prohibits any person from sexually communicating** with a child, whether online or in person for the motivations or purposes stated in Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 14 or 15.</li>
  <li>Section 13 **prohibits any person from communicating by any means with a child and travelling to meet with the child** with the intention to commit any of the offences under Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, or 15.</li>
</ol>


**3. Sexual assault can be physical (Section 14) or non-physical (Section 15).**

<ol type="a" class='pl-8'>
  <li>Physical assault is detailed in Section 14.</li>
  <li>Non-physical assault is described in Section 15, and may be any, a combination, or all of the following:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" class='pl-16'>
  <li>Lewd acts, voices, or exposed body parts</li>
  <li>Constantly monitoring, contacting or following a child</li>
  <li>Exposing the child’s body for public view</li>
  <li>Exhibiting a child to sexual media, whether aural, visual or written</li>
</ol>

**4. Sexual offenders who are in a relationship of trust with the child will receive additional punishments.**

-  In such cases, Section 16 of the SOAC stipulates that the court sentences the offender to imprisonment for up to 5 years and a minimum of 2 strokes on top of any sentence that the offender has already received.
-  Examples of individuals who are in a relationship of trust with children are parents, teachers and doctors.

**5. Not reporting abuse is an offence.**
-  Section 19 of the SOAC makes indifference to/ignorance of abuse (or the intention to abuse) a criminal offence. The punishment is a RM5000 fine.

## Types of CSA
These are the following type of CSA [^11] [^12] 

### Contact: Situations whereby the abuser makes physical contact with a child
-  Touching or fondling of genitals 
-  Oral acts involving genitalia (i.e., fellatio, cunnilingus)
-  Intercourse (vaginal/anal)
-  Penetration (with finger, penis or other objects)
-  Kissing
-  Masturbation:
    - makes a child touch any part of the body of the abuser or of any other person  makes a child touch any part of the child’s own body
    - Incest: the above acts committed by a relative of the child
  
### Non-contact: Situations in which the abuser harms the child without physical contact

### In Person
-  Sexual exploitation of the child for material gain (prostitution, the production of CSA material)
-  Voyeurism (i.e., covertly watching the child undress or bathe be it in person or virtually)
-  Exhibitionism (i.e., nudity or the adult disrobing in front of a child, exposing their genitals to a child or masturbating in front of a child whether in person or virtually)
-  Exposing a child to sexually explicit talk or materials
-  Child neglect: unintentionally exposing a child to others’ sexual acts
-  Parental incompetence and selective neglect: blaming the child  
-  Allowing someone to produce, consume or circulate media related to child abuse
-  Child exploitation (acquisition of power, money or social capital via the exploitation of a child)

## Child Sexual Grooming
Child sexual grooming is the process during which a person draws a child into a sexual relationship, whether implicitly or explicitly, and the child is then coerced to keep the relationship a secret. Child sexual grooming can occur both online and in person.

### Grooming can occur in 6 stages.
[^13]

#### Stage 1

**The child victim is targeted by the perpetrator** based on vulnerability shown by the child. This vulnerability could range from emotional neediness to the child’s perceived isolation from loved ones or having low confidence or self-esteem. 

#### Stage 2

**The perpetrator will then attempt to gain the trust of the child** by regularly observing and gathering information on the child’s needs or desires. Perpetrators could come across as being warm and attentive as well as affectionate caregivers. However, it is very important to keep an eye out for caregivers, teachers or family members who may be paying too much personal attention to a child. 

#### Stage 3

**The perpetrator will then try to be a “hero” for the child by giving them attention** and perhaps even showering them with gifts that they may have asked for. This would encourage the child to trust the perpetrator and establish a closer relationship with the perpetrator. 

#### Stage 4

In this stage, **the perpetrator will maneuver situations so as to enable them to isolate the child from others by spending time alone with the child.** By this stage, the child would have formed a trusting relationship with the perpetrator for quite some time. This isolation would further reinforce the “special” relationship between the child and the perpetrator. This may lull the child into a false sense of security and make the child feel like they are important to and appreciated by the perpetrator. 

#### Stage 5

With the trust established in Stage 4, **the perpetrator will now slowly begin to sexualise the relationship.** The sexualisation may often appear innocent at first with acts such as having personal conversations or taking pictures of the child in compromising situations or in questionable attire. The perpetrator will eventually take advantage of the child’s natural curiosity with personal touches and teach the child to respond to their sexual needs and accommodate their sexual preferences. The relationship established will now proceed on sexual terms established by the perpetrator. 

#### Stage 6

Once a sexual relationship has been established, **the perpetrator would begin guilting the child into keeping the relationship a secret to protect the perpetrator from repercussions.** Children who have been sexually groomed are often threatened by their abuser with anger, shame that they may bring to their family or loved ones, blame or the threat of ending the relationship. The victim would normally feel confused and conflicted as they fear that they may lose the “secure” relationship that they have established with the perpetrator. The fear of humiliation or bringing shame to their loved ones also keeps them from reporting the abuse that has occurred.


### Characteristics of CSA[^14]

1. Lack of (informed) consent
2. Exploitation
3. Mixed feelings regarding the abuse
4. Force/coercion/trickery
5. Secrecy to keep the relationship private

## Indicators of CSA

The most reliable indicator is verbal and non-verbal messages from a child. These include physical indicators, sexual psychosocial indicators and non-sexual psychosocial indicators.

### Effects of CSA on a child

- low self-esteem
- anxiety
- hostility
- depression
- hyperactivity
- psychosomatic disturbance
  
However, the commonality of the above symptoms of CSA with symptoms of a number of psychological disorders may present a difficulty for identification.

</ol>    

2. Stigmatization - Victims may withdraw from friends and family members
   
3. Betrayal - Victims may have a difficult time trusting other adults after they have been abused
   
4. Powerlessness
    - Victims feel that they cannot stop the abuse or it may recur at a later time

    - Victims are unsure as to when intervention may begin
    - Victims are overwhelmed by all that is happening to them
