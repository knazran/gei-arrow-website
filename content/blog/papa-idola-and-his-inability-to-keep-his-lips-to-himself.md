Recently, a few TikTok videos of a Malaysian public figure known as Papa Idola Semalaya have been going viral online and its definitely not for the right reasons. Just like our title states, this individual was seen to be kissing his adopted child on the lips. While some may think it’s innocent (like why can’t a dad kiss their kids right?), you might be surprised to learn that it’s absolutely unacceptable for you as an adult to be encroaching the physical privacy of a child (even if you’re the parent of said-child).

### What is physical privacy?
Physical privacy is when you establish clear boundaries on what you personally accept and
don’t accept when it comes to physical contact. It could be something as simple as a friendly
hug, if you don’t like someone hugging you and you’ve established those boundaries, no one
should breach that privacy of yours.


Here’s your very-basic sex ed that you **NEED** to teach everyone and anyone around you: any
touch that makes a person uncomfortable is a **BAD TOUCH**. Let’s dwell on this a little bit
further.


-  A good touch or more commonly known as safe touch is anything that would make you feel safe and comfortable, it could be a hug from your parents or friends.
-  Bad touch is anything that makes you feel even slightly uncomfortable or unsafe


A child must always be taught that their body is their own and it’s completely personal to them. No one has the rights to touch their body without their permission. Even as adults, you HAVE to ask their permission, doesn’t matter if you’re their teacher, parent or older sibling. Another element to bad touch that needs to be severely highlighted, is that any parts of a child covered by their underwear should never be touched by anyone. Going by this theory, you might think, does that mean what Papa Idola did isn’t really THAT wrong?


He just kissed him kan? Well, that is incorrect! The mouth, chest and the area between their legs and buttocks are considered completely private and personal to the child. So yes, what Papa Idola has done is gravely wrong even if his child doesn’t seem uncomfortable with it. Is this considered child sexual grooming? With the media storm that this viral video brewed, comes the question, is this considered as child sexual grooming? So, in the videos, you don’t see the child squirming away or yanking away from Papa Idola right? Well, this is where the alleged grooming comes in. Grooming is a process when someone builds an emotional connection with a child for sexual abuse or exploitation, either virtually or in person.


### So, how does grooming take place?

-  Creating an opportunity to be close to the child
-  Targeting a child who may be vulnerable to abuse
-  Introducing and desensitising physical touches
-  Introducing and desensitising sexual touches
-  Keeping it as a secret (and bolstering it as something acceptable)

Grooming breeds on a relationship of trust between the child and the groomer. Putting this into practice; Papa Idola has possibly introduced kissing as a way of showing affection (which is wrong and inappropriate) and the child appears to be OKAY with it. A child, as we all know is easily mouldable and impressionable, they’re always looking to impress or gain your attention and love. Sadly, sexual grooming is normally committed by someone that the child may already know. This is due to the close connection and proximity between the child and the groomer. And the main effect of sexual grooming is that the child ends up being confused.

We need to understand that the child is completely vulnerable to him and anything that he desensitises his child to. For now, the child is fine with the kissing and soon, anyone (perhaps even the alleged perpetrator himself) could expose the child to other forms of sexual abuse such as rape, molestation.

We, at Monsters Among Us, severely condemn his behaviour and we do hope that the authorities to take the time to investigate on this. It’s absolutely sickening that such people exist within our society, but just like the namesake of our organisation, there will always be monsters among us. Child grooming has been malignant to our society, slowly metastasizing in our midst. It’s our duty to protect children, it’s our duty to create a safer society for them, don’t fail the living hope of our nation.
