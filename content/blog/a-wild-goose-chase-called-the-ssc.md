The Parliamentary Special Select Committee (SSC) for women and children’s affairs is SADLY a worthless attempt when you enable an alleged child molester disguised as a protector to be sitting in the committee.

The Select Committee is gathered to assess, analyze laws and policies so that changes and improvements can be made in the best interest of women and children in Malaysia, especially to survivors of gender-based violence and crimes.

The intricacy of issues like sexual abuse, gender-based discrimination and child abuse should always be regarded from a gender lens. When this committee discusses these policies, they will have to inevitably discuss trauma, distress and long-term agony that comes with the issue. It is uncompromisable to expect that the members of the committee to have an extent of experience, specialized knowledge and empathy for the cause.

This is not football, these survivors are not merely statistics to be solely analyzed, we are talking about real life stories which deal with women and children issues that statistics have shown, are the most vulnerable to harms and dangers.

To put someone who has been criminally charged for an aggravated crime involving a minor, immediately proves how insensitive the process of gathering the committee came to be. Would you hire a known thief to guard your property? We’d like to think not. So the question then arises, how are we expected to create a safe and progressive society that protects the vulnerable if the ones that hold the power has lesser regards for reform and are alleged perpetrators themselves.

The sheer lack of accountability coming from Shahidan’s case as he was not acquitted but was merely released due to the withdrawal of the report on the complainant’s side was the cherry on top. A withdrawal of a case signifies that an investigation ceased, which means there are a lot more things that have not been discovered by the police.

We are disappointed to our deepest core as Malaysia has made tremendous developments in the arena of child protection, especially for enacting the Sexual Offences Against Children Act in 2017. But to platform an alleged child molester as part of the committee is a mockery to the achievements we’ve made as a nation in protecting our girls and boys against predators. It looks like we’re regressing after all the strides we have made legislatively.

It is a gross disrespect to all child sexual abuse and assault survivors to have a predator deciding on what’s best for them. It is an outright let down on women and children’s rights in Malaysia.

We would like to highlight that sexual abuse can happen when there is a person in power that has the advantage to sexually prey on his victim due to his authority, influence or standing in the society. Even when victims find the courage to report, external factors such as self-guilt, fear of society’s perception and for some, fear of his or her family’s safety may lead to them withdrawing their reports.

We call for serious action to be taken in removing Shahidan from the Select Committee. It is about time we gather credible experts and strong advocates for children and women issues to be the forefront for this committee. Its unjust to all the silent survivors of sexual and gender-based violence to allow a perpetrator to stand amidst champions of women and children’s rights. A question to be pondered upon by the SSC, would YOU feel safe in a society that PROMOTES an abuser and gives him/her the power to analyze policies that would protect you and your family? We hope that this hypocrisy does not become the death of progress that we’ve made thus far.
