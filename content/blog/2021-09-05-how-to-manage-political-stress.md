With the drastically evolving state of our political landscape in Malaysia, Monsters Among Us (MAU) is aware that uncertainty and doubt towards the future can lead to intense political stress among individuals. Regular consumption of news related to such political instability can hence lead to feelings of discomfort, anxiety and depression.

MAU cares about your mental health.

Hence, we would like to share with you a few ways to manage political fatigue:

1. Be aware of the duration you spend on consuming the news. \
   Limit your time on the news so you donâ€™t get overwhelmed or drowned by the amount of political content around the media.
2. Be mindful when sharing opinions.
   Consider two things before engaging in a political conversation with another person: \
   a) the extent of political exposure that the other deems comfortable and \
   b) the types of issues that may potentially trigger the other; \
   c) your willingness to accommodate differing opinions.
3. Choose but a few news outlets to consume from.
   Restricting yourself to fact-based primary sources, like national news outlets may be
   more evidential, less biased and more valuable to your mental health compared to Twitter feeds and threads.
4. Step away from conversations.
   Taking a few minutes away from the conversation allows you to relax and self-soothing strategies so your mental space is not bombarded with the political climate
5. Prioritize yourself.
   Assess how much political content you want to consume and how the amount or type of content can make you feel. Acknowledge those feelings and refrain from judging yourself.

We hope that these steps are helpful to you in terms of navigating the complex political climate in Malaysia. Remember that, you are never alone!
