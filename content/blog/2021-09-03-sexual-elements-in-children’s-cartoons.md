Cartoons are made for children so it should be safe for them to watch, right?

Not necessarily. Although such programs are made for kids, they are created by adults. Among these adults exist monsters who reinforce grooming by embedding sexual elements within the cartoons they create. These include sexual innuendos, inappropriate images and even elements pertaining to sexual harassment. Sexual elements were much more rampant in the 90s but still can be found in many contemporary cartoons. As these elements are considered insignificant to children’s minds, hence animators often assume it is appropriate and harmless to include them as “easter eggs'’ that appeal to adult audiences. Some producers even admit that little thought was put into these cartoons, further showcasing that the existence of such sexual elements are merely for entertainment purposes. Although children might not notice or understand the sexual contents and/or images in the films they watch, these contents pose negative effects by normalizing such behaviours among children and even groom them for sexual abuse.

One of the most common sexual elements found in cartoons are sexual innuendos. Sexual innuendos are remarks or jokes that are sexual in nature without a direct reference . Although children might not understand these innuendos or jokes, constant exposure to such things condition them to believe that it is appropriate. For example, cartoons such as Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom, Shrek and especially Spongebob have a lot of dirty jokes and innuendos aimed at  viewers who are able to grasp it--- adults. A particular episode of Spongebob showed him watching anemone, implied as porn, on tv at night. He was immediately embarrassed and nervous when caught by his pet snail, Gary.

This becomes problematic when adults who watched this as children  come to realise the references behind the innuendos and jokes later in life. By then, such inappropriate jokes are no longer surprising to them as it has become a standard feature of tv films.

Other than that, elements of sexual harassment in cartoons are often treated as ‘funny’ scenes rather than a violation of consent and human rights. This indoctrinates children into thinking that disregarding others’ bodily rights is normal in our society, hence perpetuating the same harmful culture that downplays the seriousness of  sexual-based violence. These scenes are found in cartoons such as The Legend of Korra and The Amazing World of Gumball.

These two cartoons both have scenes of unconsented kisses that clearly left the victims shocked and annoyed. Yet the level of harassment is grossly desensitized since both harassers in the scenes were portrayed as childish and innocent characters. Often, scenes of unconsented kisses are largely included in our everyday feature films as positive and romantic rather than an offense. While it may seem tiny, such portrayals will only condone acts of sexual harassment since it is seen as humourous rather than offensive. Despite viewers rarely addressing this issue and disregarding it as “naive” and “cute”, the portrayal is nowhere close to our current reality wherein sexual harassment is in fact a traumatising experience.

Perhaps one of the most controversial and upsetting sexual elements in cartoons are inappropriate visuals. These include the display of genitals, frequent display of sexual terms and sexualization of female characters. Although circumstantial, many claims have been made that Disney hides age-inappropriate drawings such as penises, nude sketches of women and words such as “SEX” are included in the backgrounds of their animations. An obvious drawing of a penis can also be seen in the Netflix cartoon Maya The Bee.

Fortunately, this episode has been taken down thanks to parents’ complaints. Sexualisation of female characters is also a rampant theme to a point that even female animal characters are given sexy, exaggerated features to highlight their gender such as pouty lips, big breasts, long eyelashes and a curvy body.

Female teen characters on the other hand, often promote stereotypical beauty standards such as narrow waists, trendy outfits and heavy make up. Is it not ironic that cartoons like Barbie and Bratz that are initially created to inspire and empower young girls, now contribute to the establishment of unrealistic beauty standards among children that instead harms their self-esteem and self-confidence?

Therefore, it is of no debate that films made for children should cater to their educational development in learning bodily autonomy and promoting respect and consent, instead of normalising the display of sexual innuendoes, sexual harassment and inappropriate images that ultimately renders them susceptible to sexual violence. The cartoon creators’ lack of sensitivity, awareness and concern towards their target audiences could poorly affect children in a variety of ways . We feel it best to not drop any names but this issue is not surprising as producers and film creators from film companies such as Disney and Nickelodeon have had their share in sexual assault and grooming allegations. 

If the creators are experts in perpetrating sexual elements or playing ignorant, is it any wonder that the films they create are just as responsible in grooming children?
