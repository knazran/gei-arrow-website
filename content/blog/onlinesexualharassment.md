Recently, an allegation was made against a celebrity with reference to online sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape. The allegations took social media by storm with more & more survivors coming forward with their stories on their own encounters with this alleged individual. The story took its sharp turn when the alleged individual made a police report against the person who exposed this story. But it reached its acme when a survivor decided to make a report on the same individual with allegations of rape.

Despite the long string of allegations tied to this person, we would like to devour the aspect of online sexual harassment involving him and the survivors. This is not the first time online sexual harassment has occured. And it is not the first time we hear someone of influence has been affiliated with such crimes. It may be safe to say that one’s standing in the society could be a contributing factor for the immediate response from the society. Be that as it may, would the potency of reactions by society be the same if this involved a “common man” instead?

Online sexual harassment is becoming an alarming issue as days go by. Sexual predators prefer to prey on their ‘targets’ online primarily due to the convenience provided by social media platforms. With just a simple click of a button, predators are served with a sea of potential targets to choose from. Compared to physical sexual abuse where more efforts are needed to reach the targets, social media platforms are viewed as a private space where predators can take their time and try various methods to slowly groom and lure their victims into their trap. A simple glance of the target’s profile will provide all details needed for the predator to tailor his/hers manipulation techniques. Predators even utilize business opportunities, education & attractive deals to break the walls between them and their targets.

It is worthy of note to learn their modus operandi. Early conversations usually do not contain any form of sexual content. They are friendly, charismatic and most importantly, relatable. Predators usually study their targets carefully before making their move. Predators are the most patient and creative beings on Earth. They choose topics which are closely related to the target & use them to manipulate the person’s emotions and vulnerability. Predators will make the person on the other side of the screen feel good about themselves and pose as a great support. Once they realize that their target is in place, they transition into their plans of sexual gratification by exploiting them online. Online sexual exploitation can range from unwanted sexual comments to having their targets perform sexual acts in front of the camera which is usually recorded & saved and this list has not been exhausted. Before the survivor is aware, much damage would have taken place.

We would like to invest time to unravel what society considers as ‘acceptable’ and ‘norm’, and when it is actually considered as ‘criminal’. Despite the number of people who stand up for survivors, many also blame survivors for ‘making a fuss’ out of the remarks made. Saying it is ‘normal’ for a stranger to leave comments and normalizing ‘sexual remarks’ as compliments rather than seeing it as a crime. And this is where we have to put a stop to the debate. If a person is making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, your feelings are valid and you have all the rights to protect yourself. If a person is pressuring you into doing things you are uncomfortable with, you can seek help for ways to get out of the situation. If a person is sexually harassing you online, believe yourself, it is sexual harassment.

Many people forget that it does not depend on the perpetrator to determine whether he or she has made the survivor feel violated, that is for the survivor to decide. Just because A is fine with getting sexual remarks by others, it does not mean you have to be OK with that. You decide what makes you feel safe and happy. And this is where the line is. Once the survivor feels threatened and/or violated in any way, society should pause and internalize it. We are fast to judge, until it hits us, then we realise that sexual harassment is more than just words, it is the power dynamic between the predator and the survivor.

Another pattern of behaviour that the society fails to improve overtime is the extreme lack of understanding and empathy as to expecting survivors to make a police report. Lodging a police report is viewed as a simple procedure in this case, when in the contrary, is the exact opposite. Of course, survivors already know that going to the police is the best way to protect them. But let us try to understand what is stopping them to do so?

1. Survivors tend to blame themselves for the crime that had been inflicted on them

As evident as it is, survivors are the first to be blamed when it comes to sexual harassment. From the clothes that they were wearing, to the conversations that ensued between them and their predators to the time that they were out when the incident happened.

2. The trauma supersedes everything their recourse for justice

When a person goes through a traumatizing event, the best thing that they think they could resort to would be forcing themselves to move on from the situation and proceed as it had never happened. Nonetheless, studies have shown trauma is best dealt with psychological support and intervention. Their first reaction is probably not to go to the police. Instead, their first reaction is to find ways on how to survive the next day without feeling too overwhelmed, violated and distressed.

3. The criminal justice system can be secondary trauma for survivors

With the lack of emotional intelligence training on law enforcement officers to prosecutors, the long and draining court processes and the absence of gender optics in dealing with gender based violence, survivors are more likely to be retraumatized by the process that is supposed to give them justice. Retelling one’s sexual assault and harassment story over and over again to different officers is normally the route a survivor has to take. Now, ponder on that, would it even be easy for you?

We agree, making a report is a step to protecting a survivor. But we also emphasize that it is only a step and not the only step. Many other avenues were chosen for a survivor to heal. Never force a survivor to lodge a report until they are ready. Nonetheless, if a survivor is in imminent danger, be calm and convince them that this is a route that they may need to consider to get out of the violent vacuum that they are in. Be supportive in the best ways that you can if the survivor does decide to report the case.

Because a police report is just the first step to a prolonged, strenuous and trying process.
In conclusion, online sexual harassment is an emerging sexual terrorism which has to be researched deeply as its cardinal features which are blurred proves it is hard to combat it on a societal level and in the legal process. Furthermore, we aggressively invite everyone to dig deeper into understanding the dynamics of gender based violence. It should never be put on the same pedestal as other crimes like stealing.

A survivor did not have the chance to decide in wanting to be a survivor of sexual violence, but you have the option to decide to be a support for the silenced ones.

So all of us are at this junction; do you want to be an ally or do you want to be an enabler?
