In conjunction with International Women’s Day, we would like to celebrate Malaysian women who have paved their way to ensure women deserve to live lives free of violence and oppression. 

Jo March in Little Women once said women have minds, ambitions, and talents. No one can deny that. Women are heroes and with our strength, we can even shake the world. And this is the story of how we can and have changed the stereotype. 

Although the journey to end oppression and discrimination is a tough one but with passion, persistence, and determination, women have succeeded in their respective industries and many are enriching the lives of others. 

Decades ago, we have seen some Malaysian women are too afraid to speak up about domestic violence, sexual assault, and workplace discrimination. They are taught to stay silent because it is a taboo topic hence why people don’t report cases of sexual assault and abuse. On the other 

hand, the patriarchal system that is deeply rooted within our society makes it even harder for women to talk about discrimination and oppression. . 

But now we see LESS of them. Many have started to raise their voices, and many have opened their eyes and started to see the need to change these stereotypes. Kudos to us women! 

I believe, we are proud when we see our sisters bravely talk about sexual harassment in media or when they fight to end child marriage, we definitely feel proud when we witness women coming forward to protect victims of domestic violence. And I believe, WE are proudest when we see our sisters realising that they should be treated with respect ***— and no one should prevent us from breaking the glass ceiling.***

Recently, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yasin has made a notable remark where he recognised that ***women have made immense contributions*** to the economic prosperity and social wellbeing of society. In making his point, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin also stressed that ***women are the pillars of the nation***, and we should be given space to flourish and unleash our full potential in all sectors including politics. 

This fight for gender equality and women’s empowerment is far from finished. There are still a lot of things to be done, and there are many things that are worth fighting for. It is my dream to see more women in Parliament as I believe only through women’s participation in politics, we can have a better and healthier political system. 

And of course, it is everyone’s hope to witness that one-day women can live in freedom— free from oppressions, discriminations, and violence. Being a woman itself is a superpower hence I **#ChoosetoChallenge** the gender inequality. How about you?
