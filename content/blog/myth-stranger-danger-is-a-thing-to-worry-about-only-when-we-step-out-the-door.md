Sad to break it to everyone, but the above statement is a thing of the past. Studies shown that 40% of teens around the world began using the internet before they were 13 years old*. As youths in Malaysia are amongst the most digitally connected in the world while the number of online predators are rising day by day, we need to start educating one another on ending child exploitation online.

According to UNICEF, 80 percent of reported rape cases by predators in Malaysia over the past 2 years involved internet acquaintances, with the majority of victims below 18 years of age. Hence, it is extremely important for us to set some boundaries on our children’s digital presence.

Here are some basic guidelines to share with children for safe online use >>

-  RULE #1:Your Username and Password Belong to You … And Only You. Keep them as a secret!
-  RULE #2:Never agree to get together with someone I “met” online. Always check with parents before leaving the house!

-  RULE #3:Be Extra Careful When Posting On the Internet. Never post inappropriate photos or personal info!
