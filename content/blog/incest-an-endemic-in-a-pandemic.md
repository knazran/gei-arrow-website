The anticipation of the recent Prime Minister’s national announcement regarding the proliferate of COVID-19 cases stung our friends with sharp and piercing pain. The possibility of MCO 2.0 gave them cold sweat above their lips and at the back of their necks. The image of being trapped in their homes, once again, made their hearts dropped. Thankfully to them, there isn’t another lockdown anytime soon.

Who are these friends of ours? Who are ‘them’? They are the survivors of sexual abuse in their homes. While we battle against our enemy, the virus, some of us have are battling with enemies in their homes. The fear of being victims of a family member’s distorted sexual inklings.

Incest has been a silenced crime that we tend to look away from the slightest sight of it. By definition, incest is an illegal and unlawful sexual relationship between two individuals who have blood relations and/or marriage between them by law, culture or religion. Malaysia criminalizes incest through many of our legislations namely Penal Code 1967 and Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017.

Section 376A of the Penal Code criminalizes any person who has sexual intercourse with another person whose relationship to him or her is such that he or she is not permitted under the law, religion, custom or usage applicable to him or her, to marry that other person. Only last 1st of October, a man was prosecuted under the Penal Code for molesting his 19-year-old niece.

Anyone is vulnerable to be a victim of incest, it transcends beyond gender, age and other societal categorisations. Zooming into victims who are children, sexual predators will take advantage of a child’s ignorance towards his personal safety. Since it is a taboo to speak of such concerns, children are not taught about incest and how they can protect themselves upon encountering a threat. Incest gets swept under the rug too often because there is a strong fear of tainting family honor. When a child is sexually abused by a family member, the child is often blamed or disbelieved, and the perpetrator is set free without repercussions. Families forgive the predators and naturally, they are enabled to repeat the crime. If we continue living in a society that is apologetic towards predators and are judgmental towards survivors, it is not a place where it is safe for children to live and grow in.

There are reasons as to why predators in homes are hounding even more now during this pandemic. Heightened stress levels due to financial burdens, limitations of resources and fear of infection do not seem acceptable in justifying one to commit incest. Nonetheless, these are environmental influences that can lead one to commit such heinous crime. And most importantly, a victim is hampered to leave his or her house easily due to the lockdown. The pandemic increases the vulnerability of victims for they are trapped in their homes or help is inaccessible.

Based on a research paper conducted in 2014, it states that “Incest is a particularly psychologically painful and damaging form of sexual abuse, as it does the exact opposite of what a family member should do, it betrays the very core of the first trusting relationships of an innocent minor towards her family thus is a complex traumatizing psychosocial problem.”

It is no novel that the psychological impact of sexual abuse on a child will only emerge later in his life once they understand the concept of healthy relations and abuse.

How we go from this point forward is what makes the difference. Considering that the climate in our country is still very instable as new clusters are mushrooming day by day, there is always a potential MCO waiting to make its comeback. So, how do we protect the people closest to us if this happens? Section 19 of the Sexual Offences against Children Act 2017 provides that any person who fails to give information of the commission of or the intention of any other person to commit any offence under this Act, or any offence specified in the Schedule where the victim is a child, to the officer in charge of the nearest police station, is an offence.

It is clear that the Parliament has put onto all of us a legal duty to protect our community from sexual abuse. Therefore, all of us must be empowered now to help those who are silenced behind closed doors. Reports or complaints can made through a phone call to Talian Kasih 15999 where the same can even be done anonymously for fear of repercussions.  Other than going to the police station to make reports, Malaysians can always opt to bring a victim to the emergency department of any government hospital as the Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect (SCAN) team will be on standby. This is a multidisciplinary team which provides specific roles like social workers, counselors, police officer and others to facilitate a case. If all means seem impossible, contact local NGOs that can provide advice or case management for your concern. You are not alone in this. Reach out.

Amidst this challenge of a pandemic, the power of #rakyatjagarakyat and #kitajagakita have strived to prove that we have each other, no matter what the circumstance is. Let us all do the same to protect our friends who may be harmed by domestic sexual violence. We need to keep the enforcement bodies in check, and we need to sensitize our senses to be alert on any harm that is coming our way. Malaysia, we can do this.
