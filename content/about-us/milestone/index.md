       The idea to hold an event centering youth advocacy as agents of change in addressing CSA came to the mind of our founder, Firzana Redzuan, in February 2017. The first intake of MAU volunteers formed the organising committee for the product of this idea: a symposium held in September the same year. By way of the symposium, our founder pioneered Malaysia’s first youth-led advocacy movement for the protection of children against sexual abuse.
       Such was the origin of Monsters Among Us: Youth Advocates (MAU).

        MAU’s growth gave rise to an imminent need to build relationships with relevant stakeholders such as fellow local non-profit organisations, child rights activists, schools, political parties, universities and local artists. During this time, the primary focus was to give free comprehensive sexuality education talks and seminars across Malaysia. This facilitated the growth of MAU in terms of manpower and allowed MAU to offer certification for its members.

         Two years after its formation, MAU was finally registered officially under the Malaysian Registry of Societies. The organisational focus then swiftly shifted to finding ways to empowering the youth through capacity building. In April 2019, MAU held Luth, a stand-alone charity play and travelled to Penang to campaign against CSA and for mental health. For the latter, MAU was able to showcase and promote local art.

       By this year, MAU grew exponentially in membership. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic among the results of which was a lockdown confining everyone, including children, to the indoors, MAU reevaluated its focus to champion safer online spaces for children. This was made directly imperative by the significant increase in Internet use and consumption by children across Malaysia. Besides that, MAU welcomed children to become advocates themselves by holding the month-long Be A Child Advocate! boot camp, at the end of which participants were recruited to be MAU’s very own child advocates.

        In April 2021, MAU decided to take on a more proactive role in creating safer online spaces and actively combating online child sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA) by launching Malaysia’s first online reporting chatbot, Lapor Predator. Manning it are active case managers who have been through intensive training and who are tasked with handling cases that are reported and providing a support system to the reporters/victims involved.
