### 1. You make a report on chatbot
You will find the Lapor Predator chatbot on our website. Questions to ask before you make the report:-
-  Have you identified any suspicious activity online involving children?
-  Do you have evidence to show the criminal activity?
-  If you are a victim, are you in imminent danger? If yes, report to us!

### 2. MAU will filter the reports
Trained case managers will receive the reports on a weekly basis, assessing its weight, and offer additional support to you if necessary. How do we filter the reports, you ask?
-  We will evaluate if evidence is enough to make an official report to the authorities
-  If the case is beyond Malaysiaâ€™s borders, we will not be able to cater to the reports.
-  We will need your contact details for a follow up to ensure we have enough information - follow up communication will be made between 14 days.

### 3. MAU will channel your reports
Once ascertaining the weight of the report, case managers will channel to the relevant authorities (MCMC and/or PDRM) for further action
-  MAU is to provide complete evidence to the authorities 
-  The police is to open a criminal file, if necessary
-  MCMC will liaise with the sexual unit of the police D11 for further investigation protocols
