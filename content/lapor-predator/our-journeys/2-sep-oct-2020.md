### Sep to Oct 2020- Building and Testing
A group of dedicated individuals has been recruited to operate the project. We also built a website which explained the issue at hand and also learning resources for the public. On top of that, we successfully developed the chatbot for reporting.

For further realisation of the chatbot, consultation meetings with different parties were organized, which included meetings with:
-  an IT and data practitioner
-  women and child rights NGOs
-  psychologists
-  PDRM and MCMC.
