### Nov to January 2021 - Live Prototype Testing
Let’s Lapor Predator is the first 3 series of live prototype testing events for the Lapor Predator Chatbot, which intends to garner a diverse set of feedback for its improvement before being launched to the public. The online testing sessions also serve to educate the community about the importance and the necessity of having an online reporting system for online sexual abuse. 

The testing sessions have formed many meaningful relationships and connections with people from different industries. We are grateful for the support given and receiving advice and suggestions to improve the chatbot. Specifically, the financial support from The Southeast Asian Feminist Action Movement (SEAFAM) allowed us to initiate and execute the series of events.
