## 2020

### Aug 2020 - Ideation
MAU had received a funding opportunity from Impact Malaysia which kickstarted the plan to address the loopholes pertaining to the reporting of online abuse. 

### Sep to Oct 2020- Building and Testing
A group of dedicated individuals has been recruited to operate the project. We also built a website which explained the issue at hand and also learning resources for the public. On top of that, we successfully developed the chatbot for reporting.

For further realisation of the chatbot, consultation meetings with different parties were organized, which included meetings with:
-  an IT and data practitioner
-  women and child rights NGOs
-  psychologists
-  PDRM and MCMC.

### Nov to January 2021 - Live Prototype Testing
Let’s Lapor Predator is the first 3 series of live prototype testing events for the Lapor Predator Chatbot, which intends to garner a diverse set of feedback for its improvement before being launched to the public. The online testing sessions also serve to educate the community about the importance and the necessity of having an online reporting system for online sexual abuse. 

The testing sessions have formed many meaningful relationships and connections with people from different industries. We are grateful for the support given and receiving advice and suggestions to improve the chatbot. Specifically, the financial support from The Southeast Asian Feminist Action Movement (SEAFAM) allowed us to initiate and execute the series of events.

In conjunction with the Safer Internet Day (9 February), the month-long campaign had been conducted to build resilience in children about online dangers.
