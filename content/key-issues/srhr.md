title: Sexual Reproductive Health & Rights Services
subtitle: SRHR include issues like abortion, HIV and other STIs, maternal health
  and rights, contraceptive access, gender-based violence, discrimination and
  stigma, and more. The Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) has made a commendable
  effort in writing a thorough guideline for healthcare providers to bolster
  young people’s access to Sexual Reproductive Health services in governmental
  health facilities, aligned with the recommendations from the UN Special
  Rapporteur on Health back in 2014. Nonetheless, the impact of the guideline is
  still in question due to the lack of evidence for this particular
  intervention.   Furthermore, MOH’s approach in improving young people’s
  accessibility to sexual reproductive health & rights services is not reflected
  in National Population and Family Development Board Malaysia (NPFDB)’s service
  provision. Contraception services in NPFDB are only offered to married women
  and do not cover unmarried individuals regardless of age. This perpetuates
  stigma and confusion on the accessibility of these services towards unmarried
  individuals in Malaysia. When young persons are removed from the works on
  SRHR, we are abandoning a huge portion of the world’s population - are we
  allowing this?

The fourth priority area in the FRHAM Baseline Monitoring Framework is ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in accordance with the Cairo Programme of Action and the Beijing Platform of Action in 1994, as well as the outcome documents of their review conferences.

The three indicators identified are: (i) laws to guarantee women and men aged 15 years and older access to sexual and reproductive healthcare, information and education; (ii) the proportion of women (15–49 years old) who made their own informed decisions regarding reproductive healthcare, contraceptive use, and sexual relations, and could access sexual and reproductive healthcare services in a public health facility; and (iii) the proportion of married or in-union women of reproductive age (15–49 years old) who have had their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods as well as are able to access sexual and reproductive healthcare services in a public health facility.

Despite having the Ministry of Health providing comprehensive healthcare services for all age groups and genders, including SRH services at minimal cost, accessibility is still a gap present due to social and religious stigma. Internally, there are policies by the health authorities that may compromise the rights to privacy and confidentiality of women at risk. “For an example, government hospital doctors are required to report cases of single Muslim women who are pregnant.”

In paralell, A UNICEF report found that Malaysia’s policies on sex education is still deprived of clear and unambiguous knowledge and information sharing. Regardless of the numerous SRH policies established, the very importance of having comprehensive SRH services, including education gets lost in translation.

In 2012, the Ministry made a positive progress by introducing a guideline on Managing Adolescents Sexual and Reproductive Health Issues in Health Clinics. This initiative is to promote youth-friendly services in all healthcare facilities throughout Malaysia. With the guideline, it will help healthcare providers in their treatment of adolescents, particularly girls who come for pregnancy-related services, contraceptives, sexually transmitted infections, and as survivors of sexual violence.

Nonetheless, there is still a severe lack of publicly available sexdisaggregated health data and gender-sensitive research on health issues in Malaysia. The State of World Population 2019 Report which captures the percentage of married or in-union women aged 15–49 years who make their own decisions regarding sexual intercourse with their partner, use of contraception and healthcare, also had no information recorded for Malaysia.

SRHR is an all encompassing subject matter that must be tackled in a multidisciplinary, multifaceted and agile approach so that we do not miss any women or girl child in the process.
