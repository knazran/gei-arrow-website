title: Female Genital Mutilation/Circumcision
subtitle: Female genital cutting is a contentious subject in Malaysia. This
  divide between those who believe the practice should continue and those who do
  not was compounded in 2009 after the National Fatwa Committee issued a fatwa
  that made it obligatory (wajib) for Muslim women to be circumcised unless this
  was potentially harmful to their wellbeing.  Different communities have cited
  different reasons for the practice including religion, passage to womanhood,
  hygiene, social identity (norm), tradition, culture, health, controlling or
  enhancing women’s sexuality, protection of virginity, peer pressure, socio
  economic status and marriageability. Though there is much debate on the issue,
  there is little to no prevalence data and research available on FGM/C within
  the country.  When norms and cultures override one’s bodily autonomy and
  safety, should these cultures still be sustained? Are we brave enough to
  challenge them? Are we in solidarity to protect girls and women from being
  victimized?

Female circumcision – also known as female genital cutting or female genital mutilation has been a controversial and sensitive matter in Malaysia. Regrettably, research on female circumcision in Malaysia is scarce.  In 2009, the National Fatwa Committee issued a fatwa that made it obligatory (wajib) for Muslim women to be circumcised unless this was potentially harmful to their wellbeing. All the same, there is still no consensus on this position  among Muslim clerics and religious leaders in the country.

Over 90% of Muslim women in the country have been circumcised. Our women provided an array of reasons to subscribing to the practice; “from health and hygiene concerns to cultural and religious beliefs, for a long time the practice here was largely believed to involve scratching, pricking or inflicting a superficial cut on the skin or tip of the clitoris when they were infants and up to the age of six” (FRHAM and ARROW, 2021). 
Tthe Malaysian government declared that “Malaysia’s kind of FGM/C” is the kind of female circumcision that falls under Type 4 of the World Health Organization FGM classification scheme, i.e., “all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterising the genital area.” 

FGM/C is performed based on traditions by village housewives. However, as of late, medical doctors themselves indulge in the practice. In 2012, the Ministry of Health proposed a set of guidelines to reclassify female circumcision as a medical practice. The motivation of this guideline is to safeguard women and girls from harm by providing access to having the procedure done at government healthcare facilities. 

Important to not be misguided by the above fact as medicalisation of FGM/C is still against women and girls’ right. In addition the medical guideline proposed by the Ministry of Health contradicts the WHO global medical strategy. 

Many Malaysians including important agencies believe that because female circumcision in this country is “harmless and did not have an impact on the sexual health of women,” there is no need for a fuss to eradicate it. It is high time we ponder on our set of beliefs and culture - “why invade women and girls’ bodies as though they are ours to decide?”
