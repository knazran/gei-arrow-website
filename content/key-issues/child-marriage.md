title: Child Marriage
subtitle: Malaysia has a dual legal system which practices a civil legal system
  and an Islamic (Sharia) legal system. Muslim marriages are allowed 18 year old
  boy and 16 year old girls. However, an exception is provided that allows a
  child under those ages to marry with the consent of the Sharia Court, for
  which there is no minimum age provided. Whilst for non-Muslim marriages, there
  is also an exception whereby children below 18 are allowed to seek permission
  from the Chief Minister to allow their marriage application.   Studies have
  shown that the primary reason for child marriage is to avoid premarital sex
  and being charged for khalwat (close proximity) for Muslims, family pressure
  and pregnancy and that “religious dogmatism and moral shaming of sexual
  relations outside marriage”. Contrary to common belief that poverty would be
  the main determinant.  So, where do we go from here? We are calling on the
  government to raise the minimum age of marriage in 7 states in Malaysia to 18
  years old for all. (Sarawak, Pahang, Terengganu, Perlis, Negeri Sembilan,
  Kedah and Kelantan).

Statistics from the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development (MWFCD) and the National Registration Department showed that a total of 14,999 registered child marriages occurred from 2007 to 2017. Without a shadow of doubt, displacing children away from schools may be one of the factors to increase the risk of them being subjected to child/early marriage.

**Child marriage** refers to any formal marriage or informal union between a child under the age of 18 and an adult or another child (UNICEF, 2022). In Malaysia, children are allowed to get married under the exceptions of both Islamic ,civil and customary marriage laws. For muslim children under 18, if they wish to unionise through marriage, permission needs to be granted by the Shariah courts whereas for non muslim children, they must seek permission from the chief minister of the states that they reside in. 

In January 2020, the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development has launched a 5-year [National Strategy Plan in Handling the Causes of Child Marriage](https://www.kpwkm.gov.my/kpwkm/uploads/files/Dokumen/Pelan%20Strategi%20Perkahwinan%20Bawah%20Umur/EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY.pdf). However two years down the road, the public and civil society organisations question the materialisation of this national strategy plan. We have yet to see the fruition of this extensive plan provided by the Ministry.

Malaysia may be seen as a strongly influenced country by its religious and cultural norms and grievously, this enables the practice of child marriage. We were once shaken by the news of a then 11 year old girl marrying a 41 year old rubber tapper. However, in the shadows, many of our children also end up wedding their romantic partners who are also children themselves. Marriage has been so normalised that in certain communities, the burden of marriage is immediately put onto the shoulders of a girl child once she reaches puberty. This detrimental gender stereotype is also weighing on our boy children as they are pressured to take on very adult and heavy responsibilities at home such as finding income for their families and taking care of the younger siblings.

#PelajarBukanPengantin which translates to #StudentsNotSpouse is Malaysia’s organic, collaborative and earnest attempt to increase the minimum age of marriage in Malaysia. The movement was led by a chain of CSO and concerned Malaysians. Malaysia must learn to create lenses where we see children as children, and not as adults. By allowing child marriage, we deprive children of many of their rights - and it is our core duty to prevent that.
