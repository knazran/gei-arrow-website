title: Discrimination towards sexual and gender minorities.
subtitle: Since 2018, there have been no positive changes by the government in
  relation to LGBTIQ persons.  Being a highly sensitive and contentious topic,
  the government evades any demands to protect the rights of LGBTIQ
  persons.   Amongst many other strong presence of discrimination against sexual
  minorities in Malaysia, there are abundace of laws that criminalize LGBTIQ
  persons have a systemic, direct and indirect impact on LGBTIQ persons; in
  particular they affect access to healthcare, employment and self-acceptance,
  among other areas.   As a state party to international treaties, Malaysia is
  obligated to harmonize the treaty into domestic law in order to improve
  standards of human rights domestically. The state is also expected to submit a
  national report and be periodically reviewed by the respective committees that
  monitor each human rights Convention. Malaysia has only been reviewed twice by
  the CEDAW Committee. In the first review in 2006, no concluding observations
  were made on LBTQI women-related issues.  “No one is free until we are all
  free.”

In Malaysia, the highest law of the land – the Federal Constitution – states that all persons in this country are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law (Article 8(1). In addition, since 2001, Article 8(2) of this Constitution has prohibited discrimination on the basis of gender as stated, “there shall be no discrimination against citizens on the ground only of religion, race, descent, place of birth or gender in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.”

However, the lack of definitional clarity with regards to gender-based discrimination has given caused the development of narrow court interpretations of the law on gender equality. “In one of the earliest cases invoking Article 8(2), Beatrice Fernandez v. Sistem Penerbangan Malaysia and Anor (2005), the Federal Court ruled that this law only applied to public authorities, and hence private sector employers had the right to terminate their pregnant employees. Almost a decade later, the Court of Appeal made a similar argument in the Air Asia Bhd v. Rafizah Shima Mohamed Aris (2014) case, i.e., the constitutional guarantee under Article 8(2) did not extend to private entities. Both judgments infringed on the right of the female plaintiffs to sexual and bodily autonomy, and further perpetuate women’s subordination.” (FRHAM and ARROW, 2021).

These legal inconsistencies on gender-based discrimination, education, women’s employment and citizenship can be rectified by passing a Gender Equality Act.  This could be manifested as the government’s commitment to the CEDAW Convention, ensuring global women’s rights standards to to be practised and upheld on the land of Malaysia. 

Former governments, Barisan Nasional (BN) and Pakatan Harapan (PH) had pledged to further this law to its realisation. Alas, to no avail as the efforts were unsuccessful despite several MPs having pushed for the implementation. :Although the latter made greater strides in this regard, its premature termination as government halted any potential progress. Meanwhile, the current Perikatan Nasional government has not indicated its position on this matter.” (FRHAM and ARROW, 2021).
