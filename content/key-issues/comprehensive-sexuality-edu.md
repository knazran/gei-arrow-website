title: Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE)
subtitle: "Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) is a teaching syllabus on
  sexuality which comprises multiple aspects - from cognitive to social skill.
  It supports young people’s sexual reproductive health development in preparing
  them with evidence-based information on their Sexual Reproductive Health and
  Rights so they are able to make informed-decisions while living a fulfilling
  life.   In Malaysia, efforts in advancing reproductive health through
  education, information and services of the young people can be seen through
  the National Policy on Reproductive Health and Social Education (Pekerti) and
  its Plan of Action that was approved by the parliament in 2009.
  However,  despite the numerous policies and initiatives in place, Malaysia’s
  policies on sex education continue to lack clarity as none of them recognises
  the importance of having comprehensive Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights
  (SRHR) services which includes education.  It is time for us to embrace this
  important knowledge openly and unconditionally to ensure accessibility to
  quality and comprehensive information on people’s sexual health and
  reproductive rights. "

In 2011, a study by the National University of Malaysia (UKM) comparing PEERS against The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)’s Comprehensive Sexuality Guidelines indicated that “90% of the respondents agreed that sex education had not been taught in Malaysian schools and the information given by most teachers is vague”. 

For years, Malaysia has been on this long and dreadful rollercoaster ride of a debate whether CSE is integrated in our national curriculum or not. Taking a look into Malaysia’s education plan, the subject of CSE was introduced back in the 90s but fastforward to 2022, the response is still similar: “Did we actually learn sex ed in school?”

What many still fail to see is that comprehensive sexuality education can protect children from sexual violence and abuse, improve their sense of self and esteem, other than understanding their sexual health. CSE is a big umbrella that encompasses life-important lessons such as ((i) relationships, (ii) values, rights, culture and sexuality, (iii) understanding gender, (iv) violence and staying safe, (v) skills for health and well-being, (vi) the human body and development, (vii) sexuality and sexual behaviour, and (viii) sexual and reproductive health).

The current challenge that Malaysia needs to overcome is the tabooness of the topic despite it being officially integrated into our national curriculum. Sex is still a topic people shy away, including teachers who are supposed to be conveying accurate and objective information to other children. Recently, Malaysian school students initiated an online campaign [#MakeSchoolASaferPlace](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/the-malaysian-schoolgirl-using-tiktok-to-challenge-school-abuse) to address the abundant cases of sexual harassment and perpetuation of rape culture within school premises. Ain Husniza, the pioneer of the phenomenal hashtag used TikTok as a platform to disable rape culture behavior that was portrayed by her physical and health education teacher when he made a very displeasing joke on rape. Consequent to the viraled video, a women’s right activist Puteri Nuraaina Balqis started an Instagram page called [@savetheschoolsmy](https://www.instagram.com/savetheschoolsmy/) to platform stories of survivors who testify how schools are not a safe place anymore, sadly. 

Our children are above and beyond realising their rights and are brave enough to demand for the better - it is us who have to catch up.
