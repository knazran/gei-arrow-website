          <p class="text-gei-primary-400">
            Malaysia is an upper-middle-income country that is already scoring
            well in some areas of gender equality and SDG5 indicators (such as
            female student enrolment in higher education, female labour force
            participation and women in decision-making roles in the public
            sector) while lagging behind on the implementation of international
            human rights agreements, particularly with regard to women, girls
            and LGBTIQ persons.

            There are significant gaps that continue to exist in the
            implementation of constitutional provisions, laws and policies
            around gender equality in Malaysia which are mainly the result of a
            lack of governance and implementation mechanisms to hold
            duty-bearers accountable.

            For example, child marriage is prevalent in Malaysia and approved
            under Sharia and civil law â€“ one of the major issues flagged in the
            CEDAW report. In theory, the fact that Malaysia acceded to CEDAW in
            1995, should have put an end to discrimination against women.
            However, problems with the implementation of CEDAW continue to this
            day. As a signatory to CEDAW, Malaysia is reviewed by the UN every
            four years (although Malaysia did not submit the report periodically
            as stipulated).

            To enable a wide range of Malaysian CSOs to conduct advocacy
            activities on the ratification and implementation of core
            international human rights conventions as well as on the adoption of
            the gender equality act and on the fulfilment of human rights of
            women, girls and LGBTI communities in Malaysia as well as to
            encourage broad-based public engagement with these issues.

            fulfilling the human rights of women, girls and LGBTIQ communities
            against discrimination and violence in Malaysia, based on monitoring
