              Malaysia is an upper-middle-income country that is already scoring
              well in some areas of gender equality and SDG5 indicators (such as
              female student enrolment in higher education, female labour force
              participation and women in decision-making roles in the public
              sector) while lagging behind on the implementation of
              international human rights agreements, particularly with regard to
              women, girls and LGBTIQ persons.

              There are significant gaps that continue to exist in the
              implementation of constitutional provisions, laws and policies
              around gender equality in Malaysia which are mainly the result of
              a lack of governance and implementation mechanisms to hold
              duty-bearers accountable.

              For example, child marriage is prevalent in Malaysia and approved
              under Sharia and civil law â€“ one of the major issues flagged in
              the CEDAW report. In theory, the fact that Malaysia acceded to
              CEDAW in 1995, should have put an end to discrimination against
              women. However, problems with the implementation of CEDAW continue
              to this day. As a signatory to CEDAW, Malaysia is reviewed by the
              UN every four years (although Malaysia did not submit the report
              periodically as stipulated).
